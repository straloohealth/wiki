# Production Deployment Policy

## Purpose
To ensure all code changes to production meet security and stability requirements through automated testing, monitoring, and auditing.

## Scope
This policy applies to all development, DevOps, and operations teams involved in pushing code to production at Straloo Tecnologia LTDA.

## Policy

### 1. Automated Testing and Continuous Integration
- **Automated Tests**: All code changes must pass comprehensive automated tests (unit, integration, and security tests) before being approved for deployment. This ensures consistency, quality, and security at each step.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: CircleCI automates our build, test, and deployment pipelines, reducing human intervention and minimizing errors. Only code passing all stages in the pipeline is eligible for deployment to production.

### 2. Approval and Rollout
- **Automated Approvals**: Approved changes are merged automatically, following successful pipeline completion. No manual approvals are required for standard changes, ensuring efficiency and continuity.
- **Blue-Green Deployment & Canary Releases**: We use blue-green and will start soon to also use canary deployment strategies to minimize production impact. Changes are rolled out gradually, monitored closely, and only fully deployed upon verification of stability.

### 3. Security and Monitoring
- **Kubernetes Audit Logging**: All deployments and operations are audited through Kubernetes logging. Logs are stored centrally for tracking and compliance purposes.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: New Relic provides real-time monitoring and alerting. Any security anomalies or performance issues trigger automated notifications to the operations team.
- **Automated Rollbacks**: In case of issues, our deployment system includes rollback capabilities that can be triggered anytime.

### 4. Deployment Process
- **Continuous Deployment**: Code merges to the main branch trigger automated deployments to production. This reduces bottlenecks and keeps features and fixes constantly available to users.
- **Zero-downtime Deployments**: Kubernetes and containerized microservices architecture allow us to perform deployments with zero downtime, maintaining system availability and performance.

### 5. Incident Response and Auditing
- **Automated Audits**: All deployments are logged and audited automatically through our CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes audit logs, and monitoring solutions.
- **Post-incident Analysis**: In the event of a production issue, post-incident analysis is conducted, leveraging automated logs and metrics to understand the root cause and implement continuous improvements.

## Enforcement and Compliance
This policy leverages automated checks and monitoring tools to enforce compliance. Continuous audits and alerts ensure that all deployments meet security and stability standards, with minimal manual intervention.

## Review and Updates
This policy will be reviewed periodically and updated to align with best practices in CI/CD and cloud-native security.
